Scalable Bayesian preference learning for crowds

- Gaussian process preference learning - Bayes based
- account for disagreement among annotators ?-> controversy prediction
- Used as base model of 2021 humour preference learning set

Semi-supervised learning by disagreement
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-009-0209-z
- use case normally unlabelled data
- "multi-view" learning may be interesting for using the given extra labeling information
  - learn across given information
